# Rules
(Official Rules)[https://www.thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/683887_TheGang_Manual-Web_051624.pdf]
Players: 3-6

Players work together to win each round. Scoring is based on Texas Hold Em poker rules.

### Round 1
Each player receives 2 starting cards and without communicating their hand, will take a white Rank Chip (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) representing how strong they think their hand is relative to the other players. Eg a player holding 2 Aces could probably safely take the "4" chip, indicating they have the strongest hand. 
- A player may take an unclaimed rank chip from the middle
- A player may take a rank chip from another player
- A player can put their rank chip back in the middle
- A player can _not_ give a rank chip to another player or put another players rank chip in the middle.

Rank chips can move around as much as needed, but the round ends when all rank chips are claimed.

### Round 2: The Flop
Just like in poker, three cards are dealt face up (aka the "flop"). Players must factor these cards in when building their best hand.

Another round of "rank chip claiming" happens (this time with yellow rank chips). Previous rank chips are still visible, and this helps the team infer information about the relative strength or change in strength of the current hands.

Again, the round ends when all yellow rank chips are claimed.

### Round 3: The Turn
One additional card is added face-up to the community pool (aka the "turn").
Another round of rank chip claiming happens with orange rank chips

### Round 4: The River
One final card is added in the river. 
Another round of rank chip claiming happens this time with red rank chips.

# Win / Lose

Each player reveals their hand, starting with the player that holds the red "1" rank chip, followed by "2", etc
The players win if the order of the poker hands follows the order of the rank chips - player 1 must have the weakest hand, and player 4 must have the strongest hand.

Note that *only* the rank of the red rank chips matters.

If the cards are in the correct order, the players get a "Vault". Three vaults and the players win the game!

If there is at least one incorrectly ranked hand, the players lose and get an "alarm". Three alarms and the game ends in a loss!
